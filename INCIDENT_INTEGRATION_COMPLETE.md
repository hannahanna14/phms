2. You'll see existing incidents with timer displays

### **Step 2: Start an Incident Timer**
1. Click **"Start Timer"** on any incident
2. Timer begins 2-hour countdown
3. Status changes to "Active" with remaining minutes

### **Step 3: Watch Notifications**
1. **30 minutes remaining**: Yellow warning notification
2. **15 minutes remaining**: Orange alert notification
3. **Timer expires**: Red error notification (persistent)
4. **Manual complete**: Green success notification

### **Step 4: Use Timer Controls**

- **Resume**: Continues from where paused
- **Complete**: Marks incident as resolved, triggers success notification

## 🎯 **API Endpoints Added:**

```php
POST /api/incidents/{id}/start-timer     // Start incident timer

## 🎯 **Incident Timer Flow:**

```
NOT STARTED → [Start Timer] → ACTIVE (2 hours)
    ↓
ACTIVE → [30min remaining] → 🟡 Warning Notification
    ↓
ACTIVE → [15min remaining] → 🟠 Alert Notification  
    ↓
ACTIVE → [Timer expires] → 🔴 Expired Notification
    ↓
EXPIRED (Incident remains open)

OR

ACTIVE → [Pause] → PAUSED → [Resume] → ACTIVE
ACTIVE/PAUSED → [Complete] → 🟢 Completed + Status = "Resolved"
```
